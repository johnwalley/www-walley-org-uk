            <h2>Ideas to Production</h2>
            <p>Go from novel idea to full implementation in days not months</p>

          <div class="span12">
            <h3>Communicate in a Common Language</h3>
            <p>Widely used by quants and analyists for its power to explore ideas and quickly build up models. See how you avoid reimplementing in C++/Java/C#.</p>
            <p>Keep core analytics and models as reusable MATLAB code. Deploy as standalone applications or integrate with other environments where appropriate.</p>
            <h3>Real World Data</h3>
            <p>In the real world data comes from multiple sources, each with its own format, is often incomplete and occasionally is plain wrong. Chances are your research and development code will fall over the moment it encounters an actual piece of data.</p>
            <h3>Industry Standard Development Practices</h3>
            <p>Apply proven productivity boosting techniques to the solutions your MATLAB users produce. This requires judgement and experience because you and your team want to keep the speed of development MATLAB enables without being slowed down by a traditional software development methodology.</p>
            <p>We can select those practices which are most appropriate for the business needs and experience of your team. A few examples are described below.</p>
            <h4>Agile Development</h4>
            <p>Quick turnaround requires you to take on board modern software development practices. The key takeaway here is that the only way to deliver a successful project in a short timescale with uncertain requirements is to iterate.</p>
            <h4>Version Control</h4>
            <p>This goes without saying and yet it is still common to come across MATLAB code-bases which number in the 10s of thousands of lines which are not under version control.</p>
            <h4>Testing</h4>
            <p>We all know we should it more. They key is to be smart about it. Avoiding testing at the start of a project is a great way to buld up <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html">technical debt</a>. Better still - automate as much as you can.</p>
            <h4>Continuous Integration</h4>
            <p>Take labour intensive tasks such as testing and deployment out of the hands of your developers and let a machine do it for you.</p>
            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <p>Can be as simple as commented code to creating your own documentation integrated with the MATLAB help browser.</p>

            <h2>Turbocharge Your Applications</h2>
            <p>Do more, or do the same in less time - the choice is yours</p>

          <div class="span12">
            <h3>Speed up MATLAB</h3>
            <p>Coaxing MATLAB applications into running as fast as they should is at its heart a simple step-by-step process:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>First up, ask yourself does it need to be any faster? Sometimes good enough is good enough</li>
              <li>Secondly, identify the bottlenecks. Never guess. Always measure!</li>
              <li>Now, apply your years of experience to optimise the existing code</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Only then consider opting for the more exotic approaches such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Take full advantage of your multicore machines</li>
              <li>Distributed Computing</li>
              <li>Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)</li>
            </ul>            
            <h3>Not just for Games</h3>
            <p>Driven by the demands for increasingly realistic visuals the computational power of modern graphics cards continues to grow at a staggering pace. These massively parallel pieces of hardware represent a potentially cost-effective source of hardware for compute intensive tasks.</p>
            <p>However, only certains type of problem are suitable for running on a GPU. And even those which are suitable can require a potentially prohibitive degree of developer effort and skill. A number of promising examples of middleware and tools are in development to make the process of developing for a GPU easier - this includes MATLAB with the Parallel Computing Toolbox.</p>
            <p>I am available to help determine if a problem is appropriate and to help identify sensible technical approaches to developing a GPU solution. This includes developing low-level CUDA based solutions. Typically this would take the form of a proof-of-concept.</p>

          <div class="span12">
            <h3>Develop Complete Applications</h3>
            <p>Developing an applications should consist of so much more than delivering code.</p>      
            <h3>Create Compelling Graphical User Interfaces</h3>
            <p>Developing a graphical user interface should never be an after thought.</p>
            <h3>Integrate MATLAB with External Code and Applications</h3>
            <p>Call out to existing code and applications. Whether you are using Java, C++, C#, Python, Scala, F# or anything else there is a way to make MATLAB communicate.</p>
            <p>Go the other direction. Incorporate MATLAB code into your existing applications and infrastructure. It could be a critical algorithm you want to deploy to production or a whizzy calculation that you want your traders to be able to use in Excel.</p>
